<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Meta was inspired by [META-II developed in 1964 by D. V. Schorre](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800257.808896). However, it was altered to suit the needs of modern-day compiler writing and is now almost unrecognizable as META-II.

Metalang features an easy-to-pickup [syntax](docs/syntax/index.md) and many extensions that make writing and testing compilers easier than ever.

It was used to write the compiler for [Gyro](https://github.com/Continuum-AI-Inc/gyro) and features the [METALS](docs/metals/index.md) specification for extended support with any language written in Metalang.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
`Meta` requires NPM and NodeJS to be installed on your system.
For faster execution speeds you may also want to consider installing [Gyro](https://github.com/Continuum-AI-Inc/gyro).

Take a look at the [getting started page](docs/getting-started.md) for further instructions.
